# fix-express-pug

This is a group of scripts and patches to help upgrade to pug.

To run use the following commands...

## Normal ##

`<clone_location>/fix.sh <clone_location>`

Example: `/home/me/fix-express-pug/fix.sh /home/me/fix-express-pug`

This command should be ran from the directory of the project you are upgrading.

##TODO##

Use sed or something to replace instead of patch so it can handle any project (IE existing apps)
